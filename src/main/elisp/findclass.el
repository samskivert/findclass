;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Configure findclass for use in Java mode by adding the following to your .emacs
;; file (customizing key bindings to your preference, naturally):
;;
;; (load "path/to/findclass.el")
;; (defun findclass-java-mode-hook ()
;;   (define-key java-mode-map "\C-c\C-i" 'import-class-at-symbol)
;;   (define-key java-mode-map "\C-c\C-j" 'open-class-at-symbol)
;;  )
;; (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'findclass-java-mode-hook)
;;
;; findclass also works with Scala and ActionScript, so do the same for those
;; modes.
